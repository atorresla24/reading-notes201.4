# Class 04 Reading

## Chapter 4: Links

* Links allow users to move from one webpage to another
* Types of lists:
  - One website to another
  - One page to another on the same website
  - One part of webpage to another
  - Open a new browser
  - Start up an email to send to someone
* Created use (a) element tags with an attribute href
* When linking to a different site it is called an **absolute** URL
* Linking to other pages within the same site is called **relative** URL
* **Root folder** contains all other files for a website
* Each **sub directory** contains a html files
* Relative link types:
  - Same folder
  - Child folder
  - Grandchild folder
  - Parent folder
  - Grandparent folder
* A link that starts an email is **mailto:**
* **Target** can be used to open link in a new window
* Links can be given to go to things on the same page by giving id attributes to html elements

## Chapter 15: Layout

* Key Focuses:
  - Explore different ways to position elements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats
  - Discover how various devices have different screen sizes and resolution and how it will affect design process
  - Learn difference between fixed and liquid layouts and how they are created
  - Find out how designers use grids to make pages look more professional
* Building blocks
  - Block-level elements
  - inline elements
* Types of positioning:
  - Normal flow
  - Relative positioning
  - Absolute positioning
* Box offset:
  - fixed positioning
  - floating elements
* Elements can be overlapped with z-index
* Float can place elements side-by-side
* Clear elements makes it so no element can touch the left or right hand sides of the boxes:
  - left
  - right
  - both
  - none
* Columns are achieved by using (div) for each column and using attributes such as width, float, and margin to alter it
* Design needs to be universal to accomodate different screen sizes
* Web designers try and make pages between 960-1000 pixels to accomodate screen size and resolution
### Fixed Layouts:

* Advantages:
  - pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning elements
  - designer has greater control over appearance
  - lengths of lines of text can be controlled
  - size of image will always remain the same

* Disadvantages:
  - Can end up with bigger gaps around edge of page
  - If screen is much higher resolution than designer's screen then page can look smaller and text can be harder to read
  - If font-size is increased then text might not allocate spaces properly
  - Design works best on devices that have a site or resolution that is similar to desktop or computer of the designer
  - Page will often take up more vertical space than a liquid layout with same content

### Liquid layouts:

* Advantages:
  - Pages expand to fill entire browser window 
  - If user has small window th page can contract to fit it
  - Design is tolerant of users setting font sizes larger 

  * Disadvantages:
    - if width of sections of the page isn't controlled then the design can look very different
    - If user has wide window then lines of text can become very long
    - If user has small window then lines can be squashed
    - If a fixed width item is in a box the image can overflow into text

* Grids allow for consistency and fluidity

## Chapter 3(First Part): Functions, Methods, and Objects

* **Functions** allow for a group of series of statements together to perform a specific task

* Function consists of:
  - keyword
  - name
  - code block within curly brackets
* To use a function you need to call it/invoke it by using the name followed by ();
* There are local variables and global variables 

## 6 reasons for pair programming:

* Why pair program:
  - Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
  - Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea
  - Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey
  - Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful, well structured solution
  
  1. Greater efficiency
  2. Engaged collaboration
  3. Learning from fellow students
  4. Social skills
  5. Job interview readiness
  6. Work environment readiness
